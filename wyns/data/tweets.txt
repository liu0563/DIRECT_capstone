@jamesdcarpenter @Capoglou @jasonrdavis By comparison, the very real disaster of climate change is creeping too slowly for people to appreciate on day/week/month timescales. Even though we've seen its effects during our lives, we know our memories are malleable &amp; undependable on decade-long timescales, so dismiss it.~~n~~13.088304~~n~~52.338079~~n~~2018-06-07 14:38:49~~n~~0~~n~~Berlin, Germany

Why we march: Rising temperatures at the poles due to climate change melt glaciers and add water to the oceans, making them rise. In the U.S., sea level rise may result in 13 million people losing their homes and a mass migration inland by 2100.

Don’t blame the messenger, blame the perpetrator.~~n~~-81.507905~~n~~28.3882177~~n~~2018-06-09 18:48:50~~n~~0~~n~~Orlando, FL

@Angry1Scientist @WalshFreedom @FoxNews There are scientists on both sides of the climate change debate.  Come up with a consensus on it &amp; MAYBE I'll listen.  First it was global WARMING. Then we find out it's actually cooled off, so now it's climate change bc y'all can't make up your minds.~~n~~-88.1249957~~n~~41.9495573~~n~~2018-06-06 02:37:20~~n~~0~~n~~Roselle, IL

@BrittMcHenry @realDonaldTrump He left early because the rest of the world (and most of America) disagrees with his stance on climate change. Mr Trump is a 2 year old, he doesn’t want to hear the word “No”.  He put his hands over his ears and left. Don’t blame the messenger, blame the perpetrator.~~n~~-81.507905~~n~~28.3882177~~n~~2018-06-09 18:48:50~~n~~0~~n~~Orlando, FL
