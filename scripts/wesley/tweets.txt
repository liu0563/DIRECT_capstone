@AndrewScheer Hi Andrew. I want you to know that people know that Climate Change affects the price of gas of course and people are viewing carbon taxes as a cash grab. That's serious, and you should be attacking the Government on this. You may be get a lot of support for this.~~n~~-79.810142~~n~~43.373074~~n~~2018-06-13 22:33:35~~n~~0~~n~~Mississauga, Ontario
